We specialized in smuggling pornography. The ship was originally built in Cadiz for the purpose of east india trading. The ship itself was built from monterey pine logs. The ocean passages were lengthy. We were sailing on the coast of Turkey. We had to sail with reefed sails for much of the journey. There was a large amount of champagne drunk during this trip and there was plenty of fighting. </p><p>I was quite fed up with sailing by 1726 so I tried to find a job on land. </p><p>It was the year 1727 when I started working as a soldier in the royal army. </p><p>I wrote false love letters from my boss  so I was fired from my job as soldier in the royal army in 1733. </p><p>But in every healthy soul, the call of the sirenes is sometimes heard.

The first mate was called Sterne.The weather was quite bright on the Gulf of Guinea. We were following the tradewinds east-ward. The crew grew tired by the drawn-out legs. </p><p>But I had gotten enough of the seas so I went ashore to find work. I didn't have very much luck. </p><p>A long time later I was debonair I could get a job as a carpenter. </p><p>You see, I wanted to go sailing once more. I found "Josephine", a rough around the edges full rigged ship. There was never a ship's crew so well agreed. We were going to sail to the English Channel. We set sail with the purpose of piloting. We were bound for Cuba and Morocco. There was a large amount of rum drunk during this trip and there was plenty of fighting. The seas were high and the weather was windy. We passed many older ports. </p><p> When I was 31 I left the "Josephine" to pursue a life on land. </p><p>But on the first friday of March in 1738 the most special thing happened - a fellow called Jack emplyed me as a farmer. </p><p>When I was 32  I got married to Elisabeth. </p><p>I got older and one day  my sensational Abraham was born!</p><p>It was in November 1782 that  my son Gilbert were born.
